KTypes or KnownTypes is a an open-source library which provides a framework to 
formally define complex data types and functions between data types inside a 
formal type theoretic framework.

The type-specified universe coexists with the standard Python type system, 
allowing for seamless switching between formally typed functions and traditional 
pythonic methods. Runtime type-checking and library recursors serve as tools 
that ensure type correctness. A library parser is provided to facilitate the 
pipeline of ad-hoc data into the formal typed setting of KTypes.
